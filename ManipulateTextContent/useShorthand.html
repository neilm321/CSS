      in 1934 the 
      <span class="giant">New York Giants</span> beat the
      <span class="bears">Chicago Bears</span>, by
      <span class="score">30-13</span>
      in nine-degree temperatures [
      <span class="venue">at the Polo Grounds</span>
      ] in a game that has become famous as the "Sneakers Game." With the 
      <span class="giant">Giants</span> trailing <span class="score">10-3</span>
      at the half, head coach <span class="coach">Steve Owens</span> provided his 
      squad with basketball shoes to increase traction on the icy turf. 
      The team responded with four touchdowns in the second half to turn the game into a 
      <span class="giant">Giants</span> rout.
